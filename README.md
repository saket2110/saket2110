Over speeding vehicle make a lot of nuisance sometimes also leading to loss of lives and other damages.
Also imposing speed restrictions through sign boards have been rendered fruitless wherein the vehicle drivers do not comply with it and resulting catastrophic.
Vehicle Speed Limit Controller project is a great solution to this problem as it not only provides speed limitations, it also implements it through a controlling mechanism.
In future, we can implement our projects in heavy vehicles by reducing the size of an sensor module and its display unit and increasing the range of the RF sensor units to control the vehicle speed beyond the range of its zones like schools and hospitals.
